# Local Model Tier List — DGX Spark GB10 128GB

**Platform:** NVIDIA DGX Spark, GB10 (Grace Blackwell), ~120 GB usable unified memory
**Memory bandwidth:** ~273 GB/s LPDDR5X (the dominant constraint for this platform)
**Inference:** llama.cpp standard build, CUDA 13.0, aarch64 Linux
**Standard config:** flash attention (`-fa on`), `max_tokens=16384`, f16 KV (unless noted), thinking off (`-rea off`), `--no-mmap --jinja -np 1`

Tested April 2026.

## The Spark's defining constraint: memory bandwidth

This is the most important thing to understand about the Spark. **It is bandwidth-bound, not capacity-bound.** With 120GB of unified memory you can *load* enormous models, but with only ~273 GB/s of memory bandwidth (vs. ~1792 GB/s on an RTX 5090), each token's autoregressive decoding must read all active weights through a comparatively narrow pipe.

The implication: **dense >20B models are not viable for interactive use.** A dense model reads its entire weight set per token; on the Spark this caps you near the bandwidth ceiling regardless of how much VRAM you have spare.

| Model class | Bytes/token (Q4) | Spark theoretical max | Practical |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dense 31B Q8 | ~33 GB | 8 tok/s | **~7 tok/s** (measured) |
| Dense 70B Q4 | ~40 GB | 7 tok/s | ~6 tok/s expected |
| MoE 80B/3B active Q4 | ~2 GB | 135 tok/s | ~80–100 tok/s expected |
| MoE 122B/10B active Q4 | ~6 GB | 45 tok/s | ~30–40 tok/s expected |
| MoE 230B/10B active Q3 | ~5 GB | 55 tok/s | ~30–40 tok/s expected |

**Conclusion: this hardware exists to run MoE models with small active parameter counts.** Any other model class wastes the platform.

## F-Tier: Bandwidth-bottlenecked

### Gemma 4 31B-IT Q8_0 (dense)
Loads fine, runs at ~6.7 tok/s. Not a model quality issue — this is hardware physics. Use a 5090 or A100 if you need a dense 31B.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Throughput | **6.7 tok/s** |
| TTFT | 0.4s |
| Weight size | 31 GB |
| Bandwidth utilization | ~221 GB/s = 81% of peak |
| VRAM (32K ctx) | ~58 GB |
| Config | `-ctk f16 -ctv f16 -rea off` |

**Takeaway:** Gemma 31B is one of the highest-quality models in the 5090 rankings but on the Spark it is unusable for any task that involves more than a few hundred tokens of output. A 5,000-character expression evaluator solution takes over 3 minutes to generate. Coding benchmarks were aborted as it would take ~30+ minutes per benchmark and the result is fundamentally a hardware limitation, not a model capability question.

## A-Tier: Strong Quality at Interactive Speed

### Qwen3.5-122B-A10B Q4_K_M (unsloth)
122B/10B-active hybrid (DeltaNet linear attention in 36 layers + full attention in 12). The flagship Qwen MoE works exactly as the architecture predicts on Spark — 21 tok/s sustained, with code quality matching A-tier 5090 results despite the much lower bandwidth.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Single-shot (temp 0) | **16/17 (94%)** |
| Throughput (sustained) | **21.0 tok/s** |
| TTFT | 0.56 s |
| Weight size | 72 GB (3-shard GGUF) |
| Bandwidth utilization | ~7.5 GB/token × 21 tok/s ≈ 158 GB/s = 58% of peak |
| VRAM (32K ctx) | TBD (small KV: ~24 KB/token via DeltaNet hybrid) |
| Config | `-fa on -ctk f16 -ctv f16 -np 1 -rea off --no-mmap --jinja` |

**Per-benchmark breakdown:**
| Benchmark | Pass | Tokens | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Expression Evaluator | 4/5 | 2245 | Test-wording mismatch on error_cases (raises ValueError but with "Invalid token" instead of "Mismatched parentheses") |
| A* Pathfinding | 6/6 (+1 bonus test) | 3280 | Wrote a 7th test beyond the 6 required, all passed |
| LRU Cache with TTL | 6/6 | 2758 | Clean pass on the hardest benchmark |

**Strengths:** Production-quality code on the hardest benchmark (LRU). Stable throughput across all 4 generation runs (21.0–21.2 tok/s, no degradation). Spark's first viable A-tier model.

**Caveats:** ExprEval miss is the same kind of error-categorization quibble that costs other A-tier models a point — the implementation is correct, just doesn't tag the error class the test expects. Single-shot result only; multi-run consistency not yet measured.

### Pending

- **Qwen3-Coder-Next Q4_K_M** (80B/3B active, hybrid DeltaNet, coding specialist) — downloaded, benchmark queued. Expected ~80–100 tok/s based on bandwidth math.
- **MiniMax-M2.5 UD-Q3_K_XL** (230B/10B active, Lightning Attention) — downloading.

## Configuration

```bash
# Standard Spark config for MoE models
~/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server \
  -m model.gguf --port 8080 \
  -c 32768 -ngl 99 \
  -fa on -ctk f16 -ctv f16 \
  -np 1 --temp 0 \
  --no-mmap --jinja -rea off
```

Per [Nauful's advice](../../../.claude/projects/-home-gisenberg-git-gisenberg-local-model-eval/memory/feedback_kv_quantization.md), only quantize V cache (not K) if KV quantization is needed: `-ctk f16 -ctv q8_0`. K cache quantization is reported to break tool calling reliability.

For dense models that exceed bandwidth-viable size, TurboQuant fork is built and available at `~/git/TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant/build/bin/llama-server`, but TurboQuant only addresses KV cache memory, not weight bandwidth, so it does not solve the dense-model throughput problem on this platform.
